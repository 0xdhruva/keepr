# Checkpoint 1: BLOCKER - Rust Version Incompatibility

**Status:** BLOCKED  
**Date:** 2025-09-30 16:56

---

## Issue

Cannot build Anchor program due to Rust version incompatibility:

- **Solana 1.18.x BPF toolchain:** Uses Rust 1.75.0
- **Anchor 0.30.1+ dependencies:** Require Rust 1.76+
- **Result:** Build fails with `toml_edit v0.23.6` requiring rustc 1.76

---

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Install Anchor CLI
- ✅ Installed Anchor CLI 0.31.1
- ❌ Version mismatch with dependencies

### Attempt 2: Downgrade to Anchor 0.30.1
- ✅ Updated Cargo.toml to use 0.30.1
- ❌ Still requires Rust 1.76+ for dependencies

### Attempt 3: Download Solana Platform Tools
- ✅ Downloaded 146MB Solana release
- ✅ Extracted cargo-build-sbf
- ❌ Uses Rust 1.75.0 (too old)

### Attempt 4: Try Newer Solana Version
- ✅ Downloaded Solana 1.18.26
- ❌ Still uses Rust 1.75.0

---

## Root Cause

**Solana 1.18.x** (latest stable for macOS ARM) ships with **Rust 1.75.0** in its BPF toolchain.

**Anchor 0.30+** dependencies (specifically `toml_edit`, `proc-macro-crate`, etc.) require **Rust 1.76+**.

This is a known compatibility issue in the Solana/Anchor ecosystem for this version combination.

---

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Use Docker (Recommended)
Build the program in a Linux Docker container with newer toolchain:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace \
  projectserum/build:v0.30.1 \
  anchor build
```

### Option 2: Use Devnet Instead
Skip localnet and deploy directly to devnet:
- Devnet has the program already deployed
- Can test with real transactions
- No local build needed

### Option 3: Wait for Solana 2.0
Solana 2.0 will have newer Rust toolchain:
- Expected: Q4 2024 / Q1 2025
- Will support Rust 1.76+
- Full Anchor compatibility

### Option 4: Use Linux Machine
Build on a Linux machine or CI/CD:
- GitHub Actions
- AWS/GCP instance
- Local Linux VM

### Option 5: Downgrade Anchor Further
Try Anchor 0.28.x or 0.29.x:
- May work with Rust 1.75
- But loses newer features
- Not recommended

---

## Recommendation

**Skip Checkpoint 1 (local build) and move to alternative approach:**

1. **Use pre-built program** - Deploy existing .so file if available
2. **Use devnet** - Test on devnet instead of localnet
3. **Use Docker** - Build in containerized environment
4. **Document as known issue** - Proceed with web app integration using mock data

---

## Impact on Project

### Can Still Complete:
- ✅ Web app development
- ✅ UI/UX improvements
- ✅ Integration testing (with mocks)
- ✅ Devnet deployment
- ✅ Mainnet deployment (via CI/CD)

### Cannot Complete Locally:
- ❌ Localnet program build
- ❌ Local Anchor tests
- ❌ Local program deployment

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Document this blocker
2. Decide on alternative approach
3. Update LOCALNET_PLAN.md with workaround

**Short-term:**
1. Set up Docker build environment, OR
2. Deploy to devnet for testing, OR
3. Continue with web app using mocks

**Long-term:**
1. Monitor Solana 2.0 release
2. Set up CI/CD for program builds
3. Use Linux for production builds

---

## Files Modified

- `Anchor.toml` - Updated to 0.30.1
- `programs/keepr-vault/Cargo.toml` - Downgraded to 0.30.1
- `programs/keepr-vault/Cargo.lock` - Version changed to 3

---

## Time Spent

- **Setup attempts:** ~2 hours
- **Troubleshooting:** Multiple version combinations
- **Outcome:** Identified fundamental blocker

---

**Recommendation: Proceed with Option 2 (Devnet) or Option 1 (Docker) to unblock progress.**
