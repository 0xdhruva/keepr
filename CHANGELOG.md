- ⚠️ Close Vault (not implemented in UI, optional for MVP)

### Integration Status
- All existing flows compatible with updated program
- No breaking changes
- No code fixes required

## 2025-10-01 — P2: Test Suite Implementation ✅

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite in `programs/keepr-vault/tests/vault.spec.ts` (850+ lines)
- 19 explicit test cases across 6 instruction groups
- SPL Token test setup with mint creation and token accounts
- PDA derivation helpers for all account types
- Balance verification assertions
- Error validation patterns

### Test Coverage
- ✅ init_config: 2 tests (success + double-init failure)
- ✅ update_config: 3 tests (success + non-admin + pause/unpause)
- ✅ create_vault: 5 tests (success + past unlock + paused + wrong mint + counter)
- ✅ deposit_usdc: 3 tests (success + zero amount + cap exceeded)
- ✅ release: 3 tests (pre-unlock fail + success + double-release fail)
- ✅ close_vault: 3 tests (success + unreleased fail + non-creator fail)

### Security Invariants Tested
- USDC mint enforcement (wrong mint rejected)
- Time-lock validation (past/future unlock times)
- Pause mechanism (blocks vault creation)
- Vault cap enforcement (deposits capped)
- One-way release flag (no double-release)
- Admin-only operations (non-admin rejected)
- Creator-only operations (non-creator rejected)
- PDA authority (token transfers use PDA signer)
- Rent reclamation (SOL returned to creator)

### Test Setup
- Test accounts: admin, creator, beneficiary
- Test USDC mint (6 decimals)
- Airdrop: 10 SOL per account
- Deposit amounts: 100 USDC, 50 USDC
- MAX_LOCK_PER_VAULT: 500 USDC

### Files Added
- programs/keepr-vault/tests/vault.spec.ts: +850 lines
- P2_TESTS_COMPLETE.md: +400 lines

### Next Steps
