# ‚úÖ Checkpoint 1: Environment Setup & Build - SUCCESS!

**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-09-30 17:35  
**Time Spent:** ~3 hours (including troubleshooting)

---

## üéâ Major Achievement

**We successfully built the Solana program on Mac without Docker!**

The key was using the **official Anza Solana installer** instead of Homebrew.

---

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Environment Setup
- [x] Installed official Solana toolchain (Anza 2.3.11)
- [x] Configured Solana CLI for devnet
- [x] Generated keypair: `GeQ3YtidFiviY7Bb7ZuZK3mEPV6XXhpmGvycH4s7dJ5S`
- [x] Airdropped 2 SOL to devnet wallet

### ‚úÖ Program Build
- [x] Fixed Cargo.toml with `idl-build` feature
- [x] Built program with `cargo-build-sbf`
- [x] Generated program binary: **296KB** `keepr_vault.so`
- [x] Generated program keypair
- [x] Generated IDL files

### ‚è≥ Deployment (Pending)
- [ ] Need 0.12 more SOL for deployment (~2.12 SOL total required)
- [ ] Rate limited on devnet faucet
- [ ] Can deploy once we get more SOL

## Build Artifacts

```
programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keepr_vault.so (296 KB) ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ keepr_vault-keypair.json ‚úÖ

target/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ idl/keepr_vault.json (24 KB) ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/keepr_vault.ts (24 KB) ‚úÖ
```

## The Solution (For Future Reference)

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work
- Homebrew Solana (deprecated, missing BPF tools)
- Solana 1.18.x from GitHub (Rust 1.75 too old)
- Anchor 0.31.x (version mismatches)

### ‚úÖ What Worked
```bash
# Install official Solana (Anza)
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"

# Add to PATH
export PATH="/Users/dhruva/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Build program
cd programs/keepr-vault
cargo-build-sbf

# Result: keepr_vault.so created! ‚úÖ
```

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Use official Solana installer** (Anza), not Homebrew
2. **Solana 2.x works** with modern Anchor versions
3. **Mac builds work natively** - no Docker needed!
4. **Anchor 0.30.1** is compatible with Solana 2.x
5. **Need `idl-build` feature** in Cargo.toml

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Once we get more SOL)
```bash
# Deploy to devnet
solana program deploy programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/keepr_vault.so

# Get program ID
solana address -k programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/keepr_vault-keypair.json

# Update web app .env with program ID
```

### Alternative (If faucet stays rate limited)
- Use web-based faucet: https://faucet.solana.com
- Or wait 24 hours for rate limit reset
- Or use a different devnet RPC endpoint

---

## Files Modified

### Added
- `programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/keepr_vault.so` (296 KB)
- `programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/keepr_vault-keypair.json`
- `target/idl/keepr_vault.json`
- `target/types/keepr_vault.ts`

### Updated
- `programs/keepr-vault/Cargo.toml` - Added `idl-build` feature
- `Anchor.toml` - Changed to devnet, updated version to 0.30.1
- `~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml` - Configured for devnet

---

## Deployment Cost

**Estimated:** ~2.12 SOL
- Program deployment: ~2.11 SOL
- Transaction fees: ~0.01 SOL

**Current balance:** 2 SOL  
**Still needed:** ~0.12 SOL

---

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ **Build successful** - Program compiles without errors  
‚úÖ **Binary generated** - 296 KB .so file created  
‚úÖ **IDL generated** - TypeScript types available  
‚úÖ **Keypair created** - Ready for deployment  
‚è≥ **Deployment pending** - Waiting for more SOL

---

## Conclusion

**Checkpoint 1 is essentially complete!** 

We successfully:
1. Set up the proper Solana development environment on Mac
2. Built the Anchor program natively (no Docker needed)
3. Generated all necessary artifacts for deployment

The only remaining step is deploying to devnet, which just requires waiting for the faucet rate limit to reset or using an alternative faucet.

**This proves that Mac development for Solana works perfectly with the right toolchain!**

---

## Commands for Deployment (When Ready)

```bash
# Set PATH
export PATH="/Users/dhruva/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Get more SOL (try in a few hours or use web faucet)
solana airdrop 1

# Deploy
solana program deploy programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/keepr_vault.so

# Get program ID
PROGRAM_ID=$(solana address -k programs/keepr-vault/target/deploy/keepr_vault-keypair.json)
echo "Program ID: $PROGRAM_ID"

# Update Anchor.toml
# Update web/.env.local with PROGRAM_ID
```

---

**Excellent progress! Ready to deploy as soon as we get more SOL.** üöÄ
