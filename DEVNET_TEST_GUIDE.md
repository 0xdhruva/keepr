- Check USDC balance

### Issue: Wallet not connecting
**Solution:**
- Switch Phantom to devnet
- Refresh page
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Issue: "Program not found"
**Solution:**
- Verify .env.local has correct program ID
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

## Expected Costs

- **Deposit USDC:** ~0.001 SOL (fees)
- **Release:** ~0.001 SOL (fees)
- **Total:** ~0.004 SOL per complete flow
