## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path

- ‚úÖ Deposit 1 test USDC
- ‚úÖ Wait 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ Release to beneficiary
- ‚úÖ Verify funds received

### Scenario 2: Multiple Vaults

- ‚úÖ Verify all appear in dashboard
- ‚úÖ Verify countdowns are independent
- ‚úÖ Release each after unlock

### Scenario 3: Different Beneficiaries
- ‚úÖ Create vault with your address as beneficiary
- ‚úÖ Create vault with different address as beneficiary
- ‚úÖ Verify release works for both

### Scenario 4: Edge Cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try creating vault with past unlock time (should fail)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try depositing 0 amount (should fail)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try releasing before unlock (should fail)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try releasing twice (should fail)

## Known Behaviors

### Two Signatures Required
**Why:** Solana stack limit (4KB) prevents combining create + deposit in one transaction  
**Impact:** Users sign twice (acceptable tradeoff)  
**Status:** Expected behavior

### Test Token vs Real USDC
**Why:** Devnet doesn't have real USDC  
**Impact:** Using test token with same properties (6 decimals)  
**Status:** Expected behavior

### Countdown Drift
**Why:** Client-side countdown may drift from on-chain time  
**Impact:** Release button may enable slightly early/late  
**Status:** Release transaction validates on-chain time (authoritative)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient SOL for transaction"
**Solution:** Get more devnet SOL from faucet

### "Insufficient USDC balance"
**Solution:** Request test USDC tokens (see Setup Step 3)

### "Transaction simulation failed"
**Possible Causes:**
- Unlock time in the past
- Amount exceeds cap (500 USDC)
- Wrong network (check Phantom is on Devnet)
- Insufficient balance

**Solution:** Check error message, verify inputs, try again

### "Wallet not connected"
**Solution:** Click "Connect Wallet" and approve in Phantom

### Countdown shows negative time
**Cause:** Vault already unlocked  
**Solution:** This is normal, release button should be enabled

### Release button disabled after unlock
**Cause:** Page needs refresh or countdown hasn't updated  
**Solution:** Refresh page or wait a few seconds
