# Design Updates - Mobile-First Redesign

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Design Reference:** `/designs/Design1.JPG`

---

## Overview

Transforming Keepr from a desktop-first web app to a mobile-first, app-like experience with modern UI patterns and improved UX.

**Core Principles:**
- Mobile-first design (optimize for phone screens first)
- App-like interface with bottom navigation
- Prominent hero vault card on home screen
- Floating action buttons for quick access
- Premium upsell section (Prime tier)
- Maintain all existing functionality (no backend/program changes)

**Project Context:**
- Keepr is a crypto inheritance app for long-term planning (Legacy vaults) and short-term emergencies (Travel Safe vaults)
- Built on Solana with time-locked USDC vaults
- Two main use cases:
  1. **Token2049 Vault** - Travel safety (reclaim on return or auto-release to beneficiary)
  2. **Legacy Vault** - Forever safekeeping with quarterly check-ins (dead man's switch)
- Mobile support via Phantom mobile browser (mobile-first design aligns perfectly)
- Mainnet-first deployment (production app, not demo)
- Non-custodial, transparent, on-chain security

**Current Color Scheme:**
- Primary: **Sage** (green #5a7a5a - trust & growth)
- Base: **Warm** neutral (beige/brown tones)
- Accents: **Lavender** (purple), **Amber** (yellow/orange for locked states), **Emerald** (success), **Rose** (errors)
- The design mockup introduces brighter/neon green (vs current muted sage) and dark gradients

---

## Color Scheme Decisions Needed

**Current vs Design Mockup:**
- **Hero Vault Card:** Design shows dark gray/black gradient ‚Üí Need to add dark color palette
- **Template Cards:** Design shows bright/neon green ‚Üí Current uses muted sage green
- **"LOCKED" Label:** Design shows purple/pink ‚Üí Current uses various status colors
- **Background:** Design shows light gray ‚Üí Current uses warm-50 (#fafaf9)

**Questions:**
- [ ] Should we introduce brighter green palette (closer to mint/emerald) for template cards?
A: I like the brighter green for template cards, it's more engaging and modern.
- [ ] Add dark gray/black palette for hero card and bottom nav?
A: I like the dark gray/black palette for hero card and bottom nav, it's more modern and professional.
- [ ] Keep current sage as primary or shift to brighter green?
A: I like the brighter green for template cards, it's more engaging and modern.
- [ ] Purple/pink accent for locked status or keep current amber?
A: I like the purple/pink accent for locked status, it's more engaging and modern.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### 1. TOP BAR (New Component)
**Design Shows:**
- Hamburger menu icon (left)
- "Locked USDC $15,407.56" badge (center, dark pill-shaped)
- Bell icon for notifications (right)

**Current Implementation:**
- Header component with logo, network badge, wallet connect
- Sticky at top, desktop-focused

**Questions:**
- [ ] Replace existing Header entirely or show conditionally (mobile vs desktop)?
A: Replace it, but I like the conditionality. What were you thinking of?
- [ ] Should hamburger menu open a slide-out drawer or full-screen menu?
A: Slide-out drawer.
- [ ] What should be in the hamburger menu? (Profile, Settings, Disconnect Wallet, etc.?)
A: Profile, Settings, Disconnect Wallet, Upgrade to Prime.
- [ ] Notification bell - should it be functional or placeholder for now?
A: It should be functional - we already have the functionalities for new vault, check ins, grace period, being added as a beneficiary, and vault closing setup, so we can have those notifications working
- [ ] Total locked USDC - should it show across all vaults or just active/unlocked ones?
A: Across all vaults pls
- [ ] Should the network badge (MAINNET) stay visible in mobile view or move to menu?
A: move to menu
**Implementation Notes:**
- Will need new `TopBar` component
- Hamburger menu needs state management (open/closed)
- Total locked calculation from vault cache
- May need notification state/context

---

### 2. HERO VAULT CARD (New Component)
**Design Shows:**
- Large dark card with gradient background (black/dark gray)
- Layered card effect (cards stacked behind)
- "LOCKED" status label (purple/pink text, top left)
- Large amount "157.5 USDC" (white, bold, center)
- "Unlock in 2d" (gray, smaller, below amount)
- "Beneficiary 5Y3...Pa" (white, below unlock time)
- Purple gear/settings icon (top right corner)
- Rounded corners, prominent shadow

**Current Implementation:**
- No hero card on landing page
- VaultCard component exists but smaller, used in list view
- Landing page has hero text section instead

**Questions:**
- [ ] Should this show the "next to unlock" vault or the "largest locked" vault?
A: It should actually be a swipable section of vaults, with the vaults not in focus being dimmed out as shown in the desing. I think the default active vault should be the one which requires checkin next.
- [ ] What happens when user has no vaults? (Show empty state or hide entirely?)
A: Show empty state
- [ ] Should this appear on landing page (/) or vaults page (/vaults) or both?
A: home page (/)
- [ ] Gear icon - what should it do? (Quick edit, settings, or link to vault details?)
A: This gear icon is actually not a settings button but actually supposed to be part of the design of the opening gear/level on the vault. This should do the same thing as clicking on the vault, ie, open it.
- [ ] Should the layered card effect be actual vaults or just decorative?
A: Actual vaults!
- [ ] On tap/click, should it navigate to vault details page?
A: yes

**Implementation Notes:**
- New `HeroVaultCard` component
- Needs vault data (amount, unlock time, beneficiary)
- CSS gradient and shadow effects
- Layered card effect with CSS transform/positioning

---

### 3. SIDE ACTION BUTTONS (New Component)
**Design Shows:**
- Vertical stack of circular buttons on left side
- Three buttons:
  1. "Create Vault" with vault icon
  2. "Add Beneficiary" with + icon
  3. "Watch Tutorial" with play icon
- White circles with icons, labels underneath

**Current Implementation:**
- "Create Vault" button in header (vaults page) and as primary CTA on landing page
- No quick action buttons
- No tutorial video/modal

Notes: I want these buttons to be 'New Vault', 'My Vaults' and 'Watch Tutorial'. I think the add beneficiary button has no use here.

**Questions:**
- [ ] Should these float over content or be part of the page layout?
A: They should be part of the page layout. They are specific to that section only.
- [ ] "Add Beneficiary" - what should this do? (Navigate to create page with beneficiary preset? Or new feature?)
A: Redundant - see notes above
- [ ] "Watch Tutorial" - do we have a tutorial video? Should we create one or link to docs?
A: No tutorial video yet, but it should open a pop up that shows an animation of how to use the app and how the vaults work.
- [ ] Should these buttons be visible on all pages or just home/vaults?
A: These buttons are specific to only that page, that section.
- [ ] Should they be mobile-only or also appear on desktop?
A: Both


**Implementation Notes:**
- New `ActionButtons` component
- Fixed positioning (likely)
- z-index management to avoid overlapping content
- Tutorial modal or external video link

---

### 4. DIGITAL VAULTS SECTION (Existing, Update Styling)
**Design Shows:**

    - Icon (globe/travel icon)
    - Title "Token 2k49 Vault"
    - Description: "Protect assets while traveling. Reclaim on return or transfer to your beneficiary."
    - Badge: "üöó Travel Safe"
    - Arrow icon (bottom right)
  - **Legacy Vault** (green gradient)
    - Icon (globe/forever icon)
    - Title "Legacy [Vault]"
    - Description: "Safekeep forever... Miss a check-in..."
    - Badge: "‚àû Forever"
    - Arrow icon (bottom right)

**Current Implementation:**
- Vault Templates section on landing page
- Two cards: Token2049 and Legacy
- Similar structure but different styling (amber/lavender gradients)
- Links to `/create?template=...`

Notes: These are the different category of vaults with details of which pricing tier they fall under:

üß± 1. Base Tier Vaults ($1 per vault)

These are the simplest, most accessible vaults ‚Äî focused purely on peace of mind and time-lock safety.

Basic Time-Lock Vault ‚Äì Lock USDC for a set period; release to one beneficiary after expiry.

Simple Travel Safe Vault ‚Äì Linked to a single flight; unlocks only after safe landing & check-in.

(Optionally) Allow USDC + SOL support only.

üß≠ 2. Plus Tier Vaults ($8 per vault)

Focused on control, flexibility, and short-term protection.

Advanced Travel Safe Vault ‚Äì For multi-leg trips or high-risk travel; adds reminders and extended grace.

Guardian Recovery Vault ‚Äì Guardians can recover or verify on your behalf if you lose access.

Cancelable Vault ‚Äì Creator can cancel early for a small fee.

Prepaid Relayed Vault ‚Äì Allows check-ins via signature-only flow (you pay upfront for relayer gas).

Multi-Asset Vault ‚Äì Supports a range of tokens (USDC, SOL, JLP, etc.) instead of USDC-only.

üí† 3. Premium Tier Vaults ($30 per vault)

These are ‚Äúlife and community‚Äù vaults ‚Äî designed for long-term financial care, family planning, and shared goals.

Multi-Beneficiary Vault ‚Äì Split assets among multiple recipients at set ratios.

Legacy / Asset Growth Vault ‚Äì Holds yield-bearing or inflation-beating tokens (e.g., JLP, mSOL, staked SOL).

Group Savings Vault ‚Äì Shared savings for common goals (weddings, birthdays, trips) with early release by group vote.

Charity Vault ‚Äì Funds automatically donated to a cause upon expiry.

Emergency Medical Vault ‚Äì Enables pre-approved family members to claim funds during verified medical emergencies.

Trust Fund Vault ‚Äì Parents can lock funds for children until they reach a specific age.

üèõ 4. Lifetime Tier Vaults ($100‚Äì$500 per vault)

These are bespoke, high-touch, or enterprise-grade vaults ‚Äî positioned for businesses, funds, and wealth-tier clients.

Employer / 401k Vault ‚Äì Employers deposit vested tokens; when vesting completes, tokens auto-liquidate and pay employees.

DeFi Insurance Vault ‚Äì Pooled vaults that release funds if certain risk conditions (e.g., protocol hack) are triggered.

White Glove Concierge Vault ‚Äì Includes fiat off-ramping, tax filing, and direct bank payouts with human concierge support.

üß© 5. Feature Toggles (Cross-Tier Capabilities)

These are optional toggles or add-ons that enhance different vault types, depending on tier:

Multi-Beneficiary Split ‚Üí Premium+

Guardian Recovery ‚Üí Plus+

Cancelation Option ‚Üí Plus+

Asset Growth (yield tokens) ‚Üí Premium+

Multi-Platform Notifications (WhatsApp, SMS, Email, Telegram) ‚Üí Plus+ with prepaid credits

Prepaid Relaying (signature-only check-ins) ‚Üí Plus+

Group Voting for Unlocks ‚Üí Premium+

**Questions:**
- [ ] Keep current amber/lavender colors or switch to green gradients?
A: Let's switch to green gradients. But actually since this is a section of vaults, we should have a specific colour and icon for each vault type. You can view the rest of the brief to see the other types of vaults, but the Token 2049 vault (the travel safe vault) can be green.
- [ ] Should cards be horizontal scroll on mobile or stacked vertically?
A: Horizontally scroll on mobile and for desktop it can have an arrow button to help with the scroll
- [ ] "Token 2k49" vs "Token2049" - which naming?
A: Actually Token2049 is over so just call it a Travel Vault
- [ ] Keep existing descriptions or update to match design exactly?
A: Good point, I actually think neither are great. I'll let you make new ones that are more apt for this design and UX.
- [ ] Should we add more vault templates in the future?
A: See notes for all the different types of vaults.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Update styling on existing template cards
- Possibly change from grid to horizontal scroll on mobile
- Update colors to green gradients if desired
- Arrow icon positioning

---

### 5. UNLOCK MORE WITH PRIME (New Component)
**Design Shows:**
- Dark card with gradient (black with subtle pattern)
- Title: "Unlock more with Prime"
- Subtitle: "Flexible check-ins, Larger vaults"
- "Upgrade Now ‚ö°" button (white pill button)

**Current Implementation:**
- No premium tier or upsell section
- All features available to all users

**Questions:**
- [ ] Is Prime tier a real feature we're building or placeholder for future?
A: All the pricing tiers and vault templates have been mentioned above so you can take a call for trying different upgrade options based on that. Since the tiers mostly gatekeep features, I think these upgradables should probably be in the vault page for features to add on to upgrade the vault. But in the main page, the templates should do the selling with the price tiers. So maybe this section can turn into a pricing and tier breakdown? I dunno.
- [ ] What should "Upgrade Now" do? (Show coming soon modal, link to pricing page, or no-op?)
A: Like I said before, this probably makes more sense to be in the vault page itself to upgrade the vault.
- [ ] Should this section be visible to all users or only free tier?
A: Take your best decision based on new information I've shared with you.
- [ ] What features would Prime actually include? (Larger vaults, more frequent check-ins, priority support?)
A: Mentioned before, pls review.
- [ ] Should this appear on landing page only or also vaults page?
A: Mentioned before, take your best decision if this question is even applicable.

**Implementation Notes:**
- New `PrimeUpsell` component
- Dark gradient card styling
- Modal or placeholder link
- May need feature flag for showing/hiding

---

### 6. WHY KEEPR SECTION (Existing, Update Styling)
**Design Shows:**
- Three icon cards in a horizontal row
- Icons in circles:
  - Lock icon: "Non custodial"
  - Shield with checkmark: "Transparent & Secure"
  - QR/Grid icon: "Trusted infrastructure"
- White background cards, minimalist

**Current Implementation:**
- "Why Keepr?" section on landing page
- Three feature cards: Non custodial, Transparent & Secure, Lightning Fast
- Icons in rounded squares with sage background
- More detail/description text

**Questions:**
- [ ] Update "Lightning Fast" to "Trusted infrastructure"?
- [ ] Remove description text to match minimalist design?
- [ ] Change icon backgrounds from sage to white/transparent?
- [ ] Keep desktop 3-column grid or make horizontal scroll on mobile?

A: These are just random points meant to indicate what should go there. Replace those with these 3, with an appropriate layout and icons:

Your Funds, Your Rules
Keepr never holds your money.

Transparent by Design
Every vault is open and auditable.

Failsafe Forever
Even if Keepr disappears, your vault works.

**Implementation Notes:**

- [ ] Should we use this specific illustration or a different one?
A: That one pls
- [ ] Where should it appear? (Landing page only or other pages too?)
A: Just there

- Responsive sizing

---

### 8. SECURED BY SOLANA FOOTER (Update Existing)
**Design Shows:**
- Simple text: "SECURED BY SOLANA"
- Gray, centered, bottom of page
- Above bottom navigation

**Current Implementation:**
- Footer with "Powered by Solana" text
- Very minimal

**Questions:**
- [ ] Change "Powered by" to "Secured by"?
A: Your call
- [ ] Add Solana logo or keep text only?
A: Add officail solana logo pls (appropriately sized)
- [ ] Should this appear on all pages or just landing page?
A: Just the landing page pls

**Implementation Notes:**

A: I'll leave it to you, make it amazing.
- [ ] Should top bar replace existing header on mobile only?
A: I'll leave it to you, make it amazing.
- [ ] How should create vault flow adapt to mobile? (Full screen steps, bottom sheet, or current multi-step?)

---

### Color Palette Implementation

**Location:** `/web/app/globals.css` lines 79-111

```css
/* Bright Green Palette (for template cards) */
--color-neon-green-50 to --color-neon-green-800

/* Dark Palette (for hero card, bottom nav) */
--color-dark-50: #18181b (darkest)

**Important Note:** Tailwind CSS 4 `@theme` directive auto-generates utility classes from CSS variables.

---

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoint:** `lg` (1024px)

**Mobile (< 1024px):**
- TopBar visible (`lg:hidden`)
- BottomNav visible (`lg:hidden`)
- Header hidden
- Horizontal scroll carousels

**Desktop (‚â• 1024px):**
- Header visible (`hidden lg:block`)

### Critical Bug Fixes During Implementation

**1. TopBar - Wrong Hook Usage**
- **Issue:** Used `useState(() => {...})` instead of `useEffect`
- **Fix:** Moved calculation into `useEffect` with proper dependencies
- **File:** `TopBar.tsx:20-32`

**2. Missing Import - TutorialModal**
- **Issue:** `Link` component not imported
- **Fix:** Added `import Link from 'next/link';`
- **File:** `TutorialModal.tsx:3`

**3. SVG Attribute Names**
- **Issue:** `stop-color` (HTML) vs `stopColor` (React)
- **Fix:** Changed all SVG gradient stops to use camelCase
- **File:** `page.tsx:135`

**4. Cancel Vault Page - Wrong Function**
- **Issue:** Used non-existent `updateVaultMeta()` function
- **Fix:** Changed to `saveVaultMeta()` with full object spread
- **File:** `vaults/[vaultPda]/cancel/page.tsx:147-151`

---

### File Size Impact

**Bundle Size Changes:**
- New components: ~85KB (uncompressed)
- NotificationContext: ~12KB
- Profile page: ~18KB
- Updated landing page: ~22KB

**Total Addition:** ~137KB uncompressed

---

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

**Phase 10 (Partially Complete):**
- Individual vault page upgrade options - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Would need vault details page modifications

**Assets Needed:**
1. Illustration (character with coins) - Placeholder added
2. Specific vault type icons - Using generic SVG icons

**Notification Triggers:**
- Currently only UI/state management
- Need backend integration to actually trigger notifications:
  - Check-in reminders (cron job or polling)
  - Grace period alerts
  - Release notifications

---

### Development Commands

**Start Dev Server:**
```bash
cd /Users/dhruva/Documents/Code/Keepr/web
npm run dev
```

**Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Fix ESLint Pre-existing Errors (Future):**
```bash
# Would need to fix 25 errors in admin/vault pages
# Replace `any` types with proper interfaces
# Escape quotes in JSX strings
# Add useEffect dependencies or disable rule where appropriate
```

## Recent Implementation Updates (Session 2025-10-06)

### Performance Optimizations

**Issue:** Dev server using 120% CPU and 3.1GB memory, causing laptop to overheat.

**Root Causes:**
1. Multiple dev server instances running (3 processes)
2. Un-throttled scroll event listeners
3. Expensive calculations on every render

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Killed stale processes** - Cleared all duplicate Next.js instances
2. **Throttled scroll handler** (HeroVaultCarousel.tsx):
   - Changed from 60+ events/sec to max 10 events/sec (100ms throttle)
   - Used `useCallback` and passive event listeners
   - Added proper cleanup in useEffect
3. **Added useMemo optimizations**:
   - HeroVaultCarousel: Memoized vault filtering/sorting
   - TopBar: Replaced useEffect+useState with useMemo for total locked calculation
4. **Removed inline event handlers** - Moved to throttled useEffect pattern

**Results:**
- CPU: 120% ‚Üí 0% (idle) ‚úÖ
- Memory: 3.1GB ‚Üí 401MB ‚úÖ
- Laptop temperature: Normal ‚úÖ

**Documentation:** All findings documented in `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`

### Vault Door Redesign

**Issue:** Vault card looked too much like a generic card instead of an actual vault door.

**Changes Applied:**
1. **Visual Design** (HeroVaultCard.tsx & HeroVaultCarousel.tsx):
   - Background: Dark gradient ‚Üí Pure black (`bg-black`)
   - Border: Thin ‚Üí Thick 4px border for solidity
   - Border radius: 2.5rem ‚Üí 2rem (more square/vault-like)
   - Gear icon: Transparent circle ‚Üí Solid purple circle (`bg-purple-500`)
   - Layered effect: Dark gradients ‚Üí Gray layers for 3D vault depth

2. **Size Reduction (~15%)**:
   - Width: 300px ‚Üí 255px (mobile), 340px ‚Üí 290px (desktop)
   - Padding: p-8 ‚Üí p-6
   - Amount text: text-6xl ‚Üí text-5xl
   - USDC label: text-2xl ‚Üí text-xl
   - Gear icon: 16x16 ‚Üí 14x14
   - All spacing proportionally reduced

3. **Overflow Fixes**:
   - Added `overflow-hidden` to outer wrapper div
   - Added `overflow-hidden` to inner vault door div
   - Prevents content spillage and horizontal scrollbars
   - Updated carousel padding: px-[calc(50vw-150px)] ‚Üí px-[calc(50vw-128px)]

**Result:** Vault now looks like an actual physical vault door with proper containment and no scroll issues.

### Mobile Space Optimization

#### Pricing Tier Section

**Issue:** 4 pricing tiers stacked vertically took up 4x the scroll space.

**Solution:** Mobile carousel with auto-rotation (PricingTierSection.tsx)

**Features:**
- Shows 1 tier at a time on mobile (4 dots for navigation)
- Auto-rotates every 4 seconds when section is in viewport
- Intersection Observer - only rotates when visible (saves CPU)
- Manual navigation via dots (pauses auto-rotation for 10 seconds)
- Desktop unchanged (2x2 grid on tablet, 4-column on desktop)

**Space Savings:** ~75% reduction in vertical scroll space on mobile

#### "Why Keepr" Section

**Issue:** 3 large centered blocks stacked vertically took up excessive space.

**Solution:** Compact horizontal card layout on mobile (page.tsx)

**Changes:**
- Layout: Vertical center-aligned ‚Üí Horizontal left-aligned cards
- Icon size: 16x16 ‚Üí 12x12
- Text size: text-xl ‚Üí text-base, with text-sm descriptions
- Padding: Reduced and consolidated
- Visual: White cards with subtle shadows for separation
- Desktop unchanged (3-column grid)

**Space Savings:** ~65% reduction in vertical scroll space on mobile

---

### Vault History Feature

**Location:** `/vaults` (My Vaults page)

**Implementation:**
1. **Vault Filtering** (vaults/page.tsx):
   - Active vaults: `!released && !cancelled`
   - History vaults: `released || cancelled`
   - Stats now only count active vaults for accuracy

2. **UI Design**:
   - Collapsible section at bottom of page
   - Starts closed (`useState(false)`)
   - Clock icon + count display
   - Chevron rotates when expanded
   - Slide-down animation (`animate-[slideDown_200ms_ease-out]`)
   - Same VaultCard component for consistency

3. **Animation** (globals.css):
   ```css
   @keyframes slideDown {
     from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(-10px); }
     to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
   }
   ```

**User Experience:**
- Only appears if user has closed vaults
- Keeps main view focused on active vaults
- Historical reference without cluttering active vault list
